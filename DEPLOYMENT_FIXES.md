# Deployment Fixes for Build and Runtime Errors

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Error - Pydantic Core Compilation Failure
**Problem**: `pydantic-core==2.16.2` was failing to compile due to Rust compilation issues on Render's read-only filesystem.

**Root Cause**: 
- Version incompatibility between FastAPI 0.110.0 and Pydantic 2.6.1 with Python 3.13
- Rust compilation required for pydantic-core was failing on read-only filesystem

**Solution**: Updated `backend/requirements.txt` with compatible versions:
```
fastapi==0.115.0          # Updated from 0.110.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.0  # Updated from 0.27.0
motor==3.6.0              # Updated from 3.3.2
pymongo==4.10.1           # Updated from 4.6.0
python-multipart==0.0.12  # Updated from 0.0.6
python-dotenv==1.0.1      # Updated from 1.0.0
email-validator==2.2.0    # Updated from 2.1.1
pydantic==2.9.2           # Updated from 2.6.1
```

### 2. Runtime Error - ForwardRef._evaluate() Missing Argument
**Problem**: `TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'`

**Root Cause**: 
- FastAPI 0.110.0 was using an older Pydantic API that's incompatible with Python 3.13
- The `ForwardRef._evaluate()` method signature changed in newer Python versions

**Solution**: Updated to FastAPI 0.115.0 and Pydantic 2.9.2 which are fully compatible with Python 3.13

### 3. Configuration Issues in render.yaml
**Problem**: Mismatched Python version and suboptimal build command

**Root Cause**: 
- render.yaml specified Python 3.11.0 but logs showed Python 3.13.4 was being used
- Build command used `--only-binary=:all:` which can be too restrictive

**Solution**: Updated `render.yaml`:
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: PYTHON_VERSION
    value: 3.13.4  # Updated from 3.11.0

buildCommand: |
  cd backend &&
  pip install --upgrade pip &&
  pip install --prefer-binary --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

## Verification

All fixes have been tested locally:
- ✅ All dependencies import successfully
- ✅ FastAPI app creates without errors
- ✅ Pydantic models work correctly
- ✅ Main application imports without ForwardRef errors

## Deployment Notes

1. The updated versions are all stable and production-ready
2. Binary packages are preferred to avoid compilation issues
3. Python 3.13.4 is now explicitly specified to match actual usage
4. All dependencies are compatible with each other and Python 3.13

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy on Render - the build should now succeed
3. The runtime errors should be resolved

The deployment should now work without the previous build and runtime errors.
